# ZSLint

With ZsLint you can lint your CraftTweaker scripts.  
For this to work you need a cutting edge version (at this point unreleased) of CraftTweaker.

-----------------------------

## Features

Press ctrl+S to save your script and start the linting.  
Due to current limtiations only scripts you have opened are getting linted.

-----------------------------

## Requirements

For the linting process to work you have to have the current Minecraft instance you are working opened.  
You don't have to enter any world or do anything, just being in the MainMenu is enough.

-----------------------------

## Extension Settings

--- None Yet -----  
Port setting to come.

-----------------------------

## Known Issues

- Minecraft has sometimes be started first for VSCode to be able to connect.
- ZSLint only lints opened files
- Syntax has to be correct for more indepth errors to appear.
